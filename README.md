OKBQA TGM Python Wrapper
=====================================

General description
-----
It is for python programmers to begin easily to construct their own template generation module.
The source code already contains RESTful API for input and output logic.
It also contains correctness checking capability for input and output values.
The only thing to do by programmers is to implement their template generation logic in middle of the source code.
The implemented RESTful API and correctness checking function will reduce python programmers' starting efforts.
